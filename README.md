## Efficient Random Sampling
#### Parallel, Vectorized, Cache-Efficient, and Online

This is the code to accompany our eponymous paper: *Sanders, P., Lamm, S., Hübschle-Schneider, L., Schrade, E. and Dachsbacher, C., 2017. Efficient Parallel Random Sampling—Vectorized, Cache-Efficient, and Online. ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS), 44.3 (2017): 29.*

You can find a freely accessible online version [in the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05141).

This is the version we used to conduct our experiments. If you intend to use our code in your own projects,
we greatly encourage you to use the code in the [master branch](https://github.com/lorenzhs/sampling/tree/master)

If you use this library in the context of an academic publication, we ask that you cite our paper:
